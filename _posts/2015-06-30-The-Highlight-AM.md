*I always find myself downloading and trying out new apps. So I thought I would share and highlight the ones that stick out. My goal is to help spotlight some apps that the majority of people are not as familiar with. Hope you find this useful! Enjoy.*

Today is a big day for Apple, once the biggest name in digital music, and now trying to reclaim its title. I think it is only right to highlight Apple Music. Apple went live today with their subscription music streaming service. The cost is $9.99/month for a single user, and what looks promising is the family plan (six users) which will cost $14.99/month. Apple Music is available on iOS, OSX and Windows computers. The service will hit Apple TV and Android soon.
