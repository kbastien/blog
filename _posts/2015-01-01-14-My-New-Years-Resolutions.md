Here are my new years resolutions (hold me to them). Some of them were mentioned in my previous [post](http://blog.kevinbastien.com/2014/12/30/14-Things-I-Learned-in-2014):

1. Read more: My goal is to read 30 books in 2015.
2. Write more: I do not want to put an exact number to this, but I want to continue to contribute to [Medium](https://medium.com/@kevinbastien), [Meet the Founder](http://meetthefounder.co), and this blog.
3. Exercise, sleep, and eat well: My goal is to workout 192 days(around 4 days a week). I need to try and shoot for a regular sleep schedule, and not eat out as much.
4. Continue contributing to [github](https://github.com/kbastien), and writing code every day.
5. I want to improve on my time management, and become less of a procrastinator.

This is the first time I've actually made a new years resolution, and I plan to stick to it!
