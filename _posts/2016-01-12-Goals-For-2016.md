Looking back at my [resolutions](http://blog.kevinbastien.com/2015/01/01/My-New-Years-Resolutions/) from last year I was around 20% successful. Although I didn't hold myself fully to those resolutions/goals, 2015 was a major year for personal/professional growth. I thought it would be good to reflect on 2015 and find the major things I need to improve on during 2016.

**My 2016 List:**

1. Cut down alcohol consumption by 50%. This means that I should drink less than or equal to 2 times a week.
2. Read 12+ books this year.
3. Start a profitable side project, that makes over $5k in revenue.
4. Post 12+ youtube videos. 
5. Be more optimistic in all aspects of life. Follow the steps to Tim Ferriss' five minute journal:
  - 3 Things I am grateful for
  - 3 things that would make today great
  - Daily affirmations. I am...
  - 3 amazing things that happened today
  - How could I have made today better
6. Don't be stagnant, and always be working on something. Write down the goals you want to accomplish by the end of the day and stick to it.
7. Learn how to play the ukulele. Practice at least 2 hours a week.
8. Learn more about music, and how to produce my own. 
9. Listen more.
10. Continue to be curious. 

*8-10 are not necessarily quantifiable for me right now, but they are still goals that I want to strive for.*

This is my list of things that I want to improve on in 2016. Let me know what yours are!
