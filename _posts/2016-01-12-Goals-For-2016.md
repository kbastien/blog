Looking back at my [resolutions](http://blog.kevinbastien.com/2015/01/01/My-New-Years-Resolutions/) from last year I was around 20% successful. Although I didn't hold myself fully to those resolutions/goals, 2015 was a major year for personal/professional growth. I thought it would be good to reflect on 2015 and find the major things I need to improve on during 2016.

**My 2016 List:**

1. Cut down alcohol consumption by 50%. This means that I should drink less than or equal to 2 times a week.
2. Read 12+ books this year.
3. Start a profitable side project.
4. Post 12+ youtube videos. I recently got a GoPro, so I want to start posting short videos.
5. Be more optimistic in all aspects of life.
6. Don't be stagnant, and always be working on something.
7. Learn how to play the ukulele.
8. Learn more about music, and how to produce my own. 
9. Listen more. 
10. Continue to be curious.
