I always find myself downloading and trying out new apps. So I thought I would share and highlight the ones that stick out. My goal is to help spotlight some apps that the majority of people are not as familiar with. Hope you find this useful! Enjoy.

Today, I thought I would highlight Postmates. Postmates is a logistics company that operates a network of couriers who deliver goods locally. In laymen terms: you can order "almost anything" you want and have them deliver it to you. This app has been getting a lot of attention. Probably due to the fact that it raised $80M during it's Series C, but also because it is continuing to grow from city to city. Feel free to check out the app and download it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/postmates/id512393983?mt=8). Let me know what you think!
